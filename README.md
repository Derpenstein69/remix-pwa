Remix PWA is a lightweight, standalone npm package that adds full Progressive Web App support to Remix ðŸ’¿.

## Features

- Integrates Progressive Web App (PWA) features into Remix including offline support, caching, installability on Native devices and more.
- Automatic caching for `build` files and static files.
- Safely handles uncached loader calls without affecting other sections of the site (i.e Throws user to nearest Error boundary without disrupting Service Workers)

Check out the new [documentation](https://remix-pwa-docs.vercel.app) for the full list of features and more!

**`remix-pwa` pre-release is here! Hold tight for a full list of feature overhaul ðŸš€!**
